WhirlyGlobeSwift
================

Swift language applications that use the WhirlyGlobe library

### Requirements

  * [Xcode 6.1 GM seed 2](http://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/) or higher
  * [CocoaPods 0.34](http://www.cocoapods.org/) or higher

The Swift language APIs have changed a bit from Swift 1.0 to Swift 1.1 and are expected to do so as the language is finalized.  The current WhirlyGlobeSwift codebase now requires Swift 1.1, and thus needs Xcode 6.1 GM seed 2. 

If you want to use WhirlyGlobe from a playground file, you'll need to be running Yosemite.

To test WhirlyGlobem You can build and run the WhirlyGlobeComponentTester scheme.

All the dependent resources are already installed in the project, but if
you wish to update a library, use CocoaPods by typing

    pod update
