The original SRTM data is public domain.  However, this data set has been modified and merged with others by:  http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html

This whole data set should be public domain, but he doesn’t make it clear.  If you’re making a commercial application, I suggest you generate your own elevation.
